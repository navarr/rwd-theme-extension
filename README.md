# Magento RWD Theme Extension Bootstrap

This small project acts as a quick & easy, copy & paste solution to extending the Magento 1.x RWD theme.

Simply drop these files into a new folder under skin/frontend/rwd/, add new or modified image files to the images
directory, update your colors and padding in \_var.scss, and add your own new SCSS in scss/customizations.
 
It's probably never been this simple to extend the RWD Default theme before!
